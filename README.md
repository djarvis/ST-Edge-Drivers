# SmartThings Edge Drivers

I forked and modified this to include a 3rd zone for my Onkyo receiver and I also added a "PAUSE" command for raw command input since certain commands wouldn't work without a pause.

Channel invitations are available in the linked SmartThings Community topics. Drivers that lack a SmartThings Community topic have not been shared to a publicly-available channel.

# Consolidated Drivers

## Z-Wave Masquerade

Allows simple z-wave devices, such as switches and binary sensors, to act as a different type of device. As an example, a z-wave contact sensor with external contacts that is set up to monitor a smoke detector relay could be reflected in the SmartThings app as a smoke detector.
